The Next Wave of Productivity Demands 5G and Wi-Fi
Shaun McCarthy

The pandemic accelerated digital transformations for enterprises across the globe. With the flip of a switch, IT workers transitioned to a remote work environment. We took meetings from our kitchens, we learned that it’s not the end of the world when a child or pet crashes a meeting, and some of us rekindled our relationship with sweatpants. It wasn’t without its challenges, but it was still a relatively smooth transition for IT workers. This wasn’t necessarily the case for OT workers, and the pandemic didn’t lead to a rethinking of work for workers in manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and utilities.

 The Future of Work is Hybrid
At Cisco, we believe the future of work is both hybrid and inclusive. Hybrid work is much more than taking video meetings from your kitchen. Hybrid work is a rethinking of networks, policy, security, and of course, collaboration. We are reimagining work not just for IT workers though, but also for OT workers. The power of Wi-Fi 6 and Private 5G are going to bring together people, spaces, and things to reimagine how we work.

As enterprises and service providers are rethinking network architectures to support hybrid work, they are increasing their reliance on the cloud for greater flexibility, connecting their physical operations with IT and OT systems, and using analytics, AI, ML, and automation to keep employees safe, minimize their carbon footprint, and improve productivity and efficiency while reducing operational costs. And they need to do this all while connecting everyone seamlessly and securely from where they need to be, aiming to deliver a great hybrid work experience for everyone. Talk about challenging! Cisco is proud to continue to innovate in helping enterprises and service providers achieve all of this.
